# A's Appearance Percentage
Using the concept of TDD which you learned in Testing course write a function with all possible test case in Kotlin to achieve the following requirements:
it should accept a list of strings, all strings should be from one character and the character should be either “a” or “b” and return the percentage of “a” repetitions. as an example if the input list was [“a”,”b”,”b”] the function should return a double value 33.3, try to think about edge cases as much as you can and test them, if the list contain a wrong value you shouldn’t calculate the percentage of “a” repetitions instead you should return -1.0.
